# CIFAR-100
In this repository, I implemented in-class Kaggle competition which for Illinois university Urbana champaign computer science assignment with tensorflow and CNN. After 4 hours training with Nvidia 960m graphics card, I got the accuracy of 61% that we placed me on the 6'th in the leaderboard. 

## Usage
To use this code run cnn_final.py </br>
To use ResNet Arch. run main.py (It use ResNet which has skip connection that prevent from vanishing gradient and for that it make improvemnt through deep network)

## Requirments
Python3
Tensorflow >= 1.0
